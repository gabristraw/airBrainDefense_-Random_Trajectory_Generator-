# airBrainDefense_-Random_Trajectory_Generator-

Automatic trajectory generator for military aircraft. This program generates random trajectories that will serve as input (in a future project) for a neural network that will identify possible future trajectories of enemy aircraft, in order to anticipate their movements and know, for example, what percentage to turn to the right or go up. The final goal is to develop a predictive system that will improve military strategy. At this stage, only the trajectory generator has been made available for public use, with the neural network project yet to be published.
